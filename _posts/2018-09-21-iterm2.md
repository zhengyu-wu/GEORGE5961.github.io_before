That was really impressed by the color theme of the Prof Xia's terminal. I just configured my Iterm2 this morning. This article illustrates the process step by step.

## Iterm2 and Oh My Zsh

**ITerm2** is an awesome terminal tool customized for Mac users which can replace the native MacOS terminal. ITerm2 serves as a simulator so we still need a shell. 

When it comes to shell, **bash** is well-known in that it is the default shell of Linux. **Bash** is not powerful and has poor auto-complete function which is quite important for a hacker. **Zsh**, which means "the last shell youâ€™ll ever need", makes up for deficiencies of **bash**. However, the complex configuration of **Zsh** disappoints users. **Oh My Zsh** appears as the improved one of **Zsh**. **Oh My Zsh** is both powerful and handy. 

**ITerm2** cooperates with **Oh My Zsh** to make your terminal amazing.   


## The configuration of ITerm2

The installation of iTerm2 is easy, like any App you install on Mac. 

I choose **Solarized** as the theme. You can change your theme following **Preferences -> Profiles -> Colors -> Color Presets**.

Then you can highlight the dictionary by going to **Preferences -> Profiles -> Text -> Text Rendering** and uncheck the option `Draw bold text in bright colors`.

To show the proper characters in the terminal, you should also install **Powerline font**.

I follow the instructions on the [https://github.com/powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

```
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
# install
cd fonts
./install.sh
# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts
```

I entered these instructions but it still doesn't work in the terminal. Some certain symbols are replaced by some weired symbols such as ?.

In this case, go to **Preferences -> Profiles -> Text -> Change font** to select the fonts suffixed with "for Powerlines" such as "12pt Meslo LG S DZ Regular for Powerlines".

Now the configure of iTerm2 is finished.

## The configuration of OhMyZsh

First, check if you have installed OhMyZsh.

```
cat /etc/shells

...
...
/bin/bash
/bin/sh
/bin/zsh
...
...
```

If you get this result, it shows that you have installed zsh and OhMyZsh.

You can download any theme you like from the [official site](https://ohmyz.sh/) and add the file under ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes.

Then modify ~/.zshrc and change ZSH_THEME. My file ~/.zshrc shows as follows. You need to change ZSH\_THEME in the 9th line. 

```
vi ~/.zshrc

```

```
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH="/Users/wuzhengyu/.oh-my-zsh"

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="lambda-mod"

# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a theme from this variable instead of looking in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
# ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" )

# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
# Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.
# HYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable bi-weekly auto-update checks.
"~/.zshrc" 98L, 3404C
```

The default theme is **robbyrussell**. Here I have set it to **lambda-mod**. Popular theme includes **agnoster**. Someone naughty makes the theme random.

```
ZSH_THEME="random" # (...please let it be pie... please be some pie..)
And if you want to pick random theme from a list of your favorite themes:
```

And you can pick random theme from a list:

```
ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=(
  "robbyrussell"
  "agnoster"
)
```

OhMyZsh has many amazing features. For example, entering d will show the recent path you visited. Enter the conresponding path number then you will go to that path.

Explore your terminal and enjoy hacking.
