Today I'll give an intro of a handy pulg-in which is called SFTP. Actually SFTP is a transfer propotol like FTP. SFTP will update the remote machine with the local change of files. In other words, any change to a local file can be synchronized to a remote machine automatically.

SFTP is applied in many places but this article only focuses how to incorporate it in Vscode editor, my favorite editor.

## Usage

1. Install SFTP plug-in in Vscode.

Note that:

1. The meaning of parameters in sftp.json: 
	
	* **host** refers to the ip of a remote machine.
	* **username**  and **password** are the username and password of a remote machine, which is similar to ssh login.
	* **remotePath** is the file path in a remote machine.

2. **autoUpload** and **autoDelete** are not recommanded because any misoperation will be updated on the other side which may bring about disasters.

3. You can ignore some abundant files by the ignore option, say, .git files.

4. Downloading from a remote machine to a local machine works as well.
