You may know a task called labelling a dataset. This article tells how to use a tool, **labelImg**, to label the objects of a image.

At first, I thought Photoshop was applied to draw a colored box to label an object. That was really silly thoughts :(. Yesterday I just heared a tool called **labelImg** which is prevalent in some field such as object detection.

**labelImg** is a graphical image annotation tool, which is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface.

Annotations are saved as **XML** files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet.

## The installation of labelImg

The installation of labelImg is abosulately a grind.I failed to install on my Mac and it took some efforts to install on Ubuntu.

The official document is [here](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) which may be confusing to you.

Next I will introduce how I succeed in installing on Ubuntu.

First, your machine needs to have **python** and **pip**. I will not spare redundant words here explaining this step.

Second, type in directly:

```
pip install labelImg
```
 
Commonly, there is no question in the second step and you will get the following message.

Now I tested whether it can work or not.

Oops! It reminded me of not installing Qt. It is not hard to fix. Type in the following instruction.

```
sudo apt-get install python-qt4
```

I tested it again.

It still didn't work. Luckily, it seems to be the similar problem as last time.  I still depended on pip and enter
	
```
pip install lxml
```

Now when I typed in 

```
labelImg
```

There are no bugs and an interface popped up. Bingo!

## The usage of labelImg

I highly recommand the [official video](https://youtu.be/p0nR2YsCY_U). The GUI of labelImg is quite user-friendly and you can simply learn it.

The following image shows I mark the knee in an original medical image.

Then let's take a look at the saved XML file.

```
vim test.xml
```

<img  src="https://github.com/GEORGE5961/markdown_photos/blob/master/6.png?raw=true" width="80%" height="60%" />

Note that the XML file now includes the object tag and has the exact class name what I annotated before.

Next I will mark thousands of images and do some certain detection task. If all fares well, I'd love to write about my project in the next few articles.
